## Fitness Equation

This is an app that
1. Predicts your weight loss/gain timeline!
2. Calculates your one rep max for any exercise for any body part or compound lifts!
3. Records your weightlifting routines to track your progress over time!

This project addresses the obesity epidemic in America. Can be used with all populations regardless of race, gender, religion. As a personal trainer, I often couldn't tell my clients when exactly they should reach goal weight in a healthy timeline
