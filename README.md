# Fitness Equation 

## Description:
An app that predicts the shortest amount of time to reach your goal weight.


## Pain Point


This project addresses the obesity epidemic in America. Can be used with all populations regardless of race, gender, religion. 
As a personal trainer, I often couldn't tell my clients when exactly they should reach goal weight in a healthy timeline

## Target User Persona


- Personal trainers
- People who want to lose weight
- People who want to envision a healthier reality for themselves!

## Hypothesis
If a person uses fitness equation to lose weight, they will achieve their goals in the shortest amount of time to reach their goal weight.


## User Stories

- As a person trying to lose weight, I want to be able to convert my height from feet and inches to cm, and my weight from lbs to kg, so that I'm able to visualize my atheletic potential in different metrics.
